Dragonflies and damselflies have excellent vision due to their two large compound eyes, and their powerful toothed mandibles allow them to eat hard-skinned animals, like beetles. Contrary to popular belief, dragonflies do not have a sting (and therefore do not sting). Despite being strange looking insects, they are very useful to humans as they feed on considerable amounts of flies and insects. Dragonflies and damselflies are quite distinctive insects: they are distinguished by their long and slender bodies displaying two pairs of wings, with complex venation. The antennae are very short. There are around 5,700 Odonata species in the world.

Their strong muscles allow them to have a fast flight and to be effective hunters. Being essentially aquatic animals they need water to complete their life cycle. However, due to their powerful flight ability, adults are often seen far away from the rivers and streams where they were born. Dragonflies are frequently found in forest clearings hunting insects, in places warmed by the sun.\n\n                More information in the Catalog of the Exhibition \"Insects in Order\".\n            ",

Dragonflies and damselflies have excellent vision due to their two large compound eyes, and their powerful toothed mandibles allow them to eat hard-skinned animals, like beetles. Contrary to popular belief, dragonflies do not have a sting (and therefore do not sting).

When at rest, they keep their wings closed or slightly open in a vertical position. Their compound eyes, set at opposite positions, form a structure that resembles a small hammer. Damsels are delicate insects with a graceful and slow flight. Since damsels are not very fast, they catch their prey while at rest, usually on vegetation.\n\n                More information in the Catalog of the Exhibition \"Insects in Order\".\n            ",
